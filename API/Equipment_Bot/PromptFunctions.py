Based on this information and the selected crew for the project, you need to choose the most suitable equipment and explain your preference.

     Select equipement according to the specification needed. Here is the datails about their specification: {specification}.
     Match Equipment to Crew: Select equipment that best fits the crew's roles and the number of crew members. For example, if we need to shoot a scene from two different angles and have equal to or more than two camera operators, we can select two cameras. However, if there is only one camera operator, you should select only one camera.
     Assign Equipment Accordingly: Ensure that the equipment is suitable for the crew members available. If a specific piece of equipment requires a specific crew member and none are available, try to assign it to another crew member. If no one can operate it, exclude that equipment.
     Rationale for Selection: Make sure to explain why you prefer a particular piece of equipment. This could be based on compatibility, ease of use, the specific needs of the project, or the capabilities of the crew.
     The output should be in JSON format which should follow this: ['name', 'model', 'brand', 'number_needed', 'Preferred_because', 'provider_email']. Only output JSON. You don't need to put anything extra as your output will be directly fed to a function, so just output JSON.
