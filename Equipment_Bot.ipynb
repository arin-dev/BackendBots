The primary location for this project will be the animation studio, where the team will handle tasks such as storyboarding, character design, 3D modeling, texturing, rigging, animation, lighting, and rendering. Additionally, there may be a need for a sound studio to record and mix audio elements, including voiceovers, sound effects, and background music. The same team of animators, designers, and audio engineers will work on the project, but they may need to travel between the animation studio and the sound studio to ensure seamless integration of visual and audio components. The goal is to produce a high-quality, visually stunning 3D movie that effectively showcases the spaceship in various scenes and scenarios.\n",
